The value of caring

## Introduction

We’d like to tell you about a narrative that has been very useful for us in the coaching work we have been doing during the last year with several teams.

## Origin

It all started during a consultancy work that [Joan Valduvieco](https://twitter.com/jvalduvieco?lang=en) and I did at the beginning of 2019 at [Trovit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trovit). [José Carlos Gil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josecgil/) and [Edu Mateu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardmateu/) had brought us to help Trovit's B2B team. We spent a week with the team asking questions, observing their work and doing some group dynamics to try to understand how we might help them.

After that week of "field work" we had gathered a ton of notes, graphs and insights that we needed to put in order and analyze. This is always a difficult task because it is about analyzing a sociotechnical system (team, knowledge, technology, existing code, organization, pressure, changes,...) which is a complex system in constant flux, and even more difficult in a short period of time. In a way, you have to accept that it is something you can't wholly understand.

Having that in mind, we tried to do our best to get a first approximation by representing the different dynamics and processes we had observed in several [causal loop diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop_diagram). This work helped us clarify our minds and highlight how habits, knowledge, beliefs, culture and practices were creating vicious cycles, (positive feedback loops in the causal loop diagram <- enganchar una nota al pie que aclare lo que significa positive en este contexto),  that were amplifying and preserving destructive effects for the team and its software which made their system less habitable and sustainable, and created inefficiencies and loss of value.

After that we started to think about strategies that might break those vicious cycles, either by reducing the effect of some node (a problematic habit, practice or belief), by removing an interaction between nodes in a positive loop, or introducing negative feedback in the system (new practices and habits) to stabilize it.

[Donella H. Meadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donella_Meadows) in her book [Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems) talks about different types of [leverage points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_leverage_points) which are places within a complex system where you can try to apply what we call **change levers** to make the system evolve from its current dynamics into another that might be more interesting for the team.

We detected several **change levers** that might be applied to the system at different leverage points  to improve the sustainability of the system, such as, "Improving Technical Skills", "Knowledge Diffusion", "Knowledge Crystallization", "Changing Habits", "All Team Product Owning" or "Remote First".

All of them attacked vicious cycles that were entrenched in the team's dynamics, and are valuable in themselves, but we were not sure that they would be enough to change the system's current dynamics. Something that we observed during our field work was that the team was very skeptical about the probabilities of success of any initiative to improve its situation. They had gone through several failed attempts of "Agile" transformation before, and this has left them in a kind of state of learned helplessness. Why had those previous attempts failed? Would ours succeed using our **change levers**?

We started to realize that there was a deeper force at play that was exacerbating the rest of the problems and would reduce the effect of any of the other **change levers**. We realized that they would be useless unless the team had enough slack and company support to apply them. The deeper and stronger force that was inhibiting the possibility of having that slack and support was the very conception of what value meant for the company, it was a cultural problem.

</div>



We then come up with a new **change lever**: "Redefinition of Value". This was the most powerful **change lever** of all the ones we had detected because it was a cultural change (nota according to Donella Meadows cultural blabla are blabla y relacionar con 12 leverage points article), and it would increase the probabilities of success of all other **change levers**. Being a cultural change also made it  the most difficult to apply.

## Redefinition of Value

What was this "Redefinition of Value" **change lever** about?

The culture of the team was understanding value only as producing features for their clients as quickly as possible. This definition of value only includes certain type of tasks, the ones that directly produce features,
but excludes many tasks that don't directly produce features, but that are necessary for the sustainability of the system (the business and team) itself. The first kind of work is called productive work and the second kind is called caring work (or reproductive work <- mover esto a una nota al pie) [incluir aquí una nota al pie This idea of caring tasks comes from a gender perspective of economics, link al artículo sobre caring work y sobre feminist economics]

Believing that only one type of work has value, (productive work), and then focusing only in that type of work is an extractive micro-optimization that might end destabilizing the system (incluir nota Sadly you can observe this at all scales: a business, a relationship, an ecosystem, the planet).

<div style="max-width:550px; overflow: hidden; margin:auto;">
<img src="/assets/caring_traditional_model.png" alt="Model biased to productive work" />
</div>



The redefinition of value we proposed was that not only producing features for the client as quickly as possible is valuable, that there is also value in keeping the sustainability of the business and team. Aside from working on productive tasks, you need to devote energy and time to work on caring tasks which are concerned with keeping the health of the ecosystem comprised by the code, the team and the client, so that it can continue evolving, being habitable for the team and producing value. We think that this kind of work (caring work) has value and is strategic for a company.
If you think about it, at the bottom, this is about seeing the team as the real product and establishing a healthier and more durable relationship with clients.

This idea of caring work comes from economic studies from a gender perspective. In feminist economics caring work is defined as, "those occupations that provide services that help people develop their capabilities, or the ability to pursue the aspects of their lives that they value" or "necessary occupations and care to sustain life and human survival".

<img src="/assets/caring_redefining_value.png" alt="Redefinition of value" />
</div>



We thought that for this redefinition of value to be successful, it needed to be stated very clearly to the team from above. This clarity is crucial to avoid the developers having to solve the conflicts that arise when the value of caring tasks is not clear. In those cases, it's often caring work which gets neglected.

Those conflicts are actually strategical and, as such, should be resolved at the right level so that the team receives a clear message that gives them focus and the peace of mind that they are always working in something that is really valued by the company.

In many companies the value of caring only appears in company statements (corporate language), but it's not part of the real culture, the real system of values of the company. This situation creates  a kind of doublespeak that might be very harmful. A way to avoid that might be putting your money where your mouth is.

So with all these ingredients we cooked a presentation for the team lead, the CTO and the CPO of the company, to tell them the strategy we would like to follow, the cultural change involved in the redefinition of value that we thought necessary and how we thought that the possible conflicts between the two types of work should be resolved at their level. They listened to us and decided to try. They were very brave and this decision enabled a wonderful change in the team we started to work with (añadir nota al pie reconociendo el gran trabajo de B2B). The success of this experiment made it possible for other teams to start experimenting with this redefinition of value as well.

## Is this not the metaphor of technical debt in a different guise? (<- agradecer a Alfredo y Fran su contribución a esta sección)

We think that the narrative of caring work, it’s not equivalent to technical debt. 

The technical debt metaphor has evolved a lot from the concept that Ward Cunningham originally coined (añadir nota). With time the metaphor was extended to cover blabla. This extended use of the metaphor has being criticized by some software practitioners (nota sobre Robert C. Martin y Steve Freeman views about the metaphor). Leaving this debate aside, most people understand the technical debt metaphor as:
> “design or implementation constructs that are expedient in the short term but that set up a technical context that can make a future change more costly or impossible. Technical debt is a contingent liability whose impact is limited to internal systems qualities - primarily, but not only, maintainability and evolvability.” from [Managing Technical Debt: Reducing Friction in Software Development](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42778944-managing-technical-debt)

(poner aquí la imagen que hizo Pau)



in the sense that it does not describe technical problems that cause friction in software development

goes beyond technical debt. They are not

## How are we applying it at the moment?

## Conclusion

Hablar del éxito de la experiencia hasta ahora, y de cómo nos hemos sentido cómodos para acoger procesos de mejora que hacen aguas dentro de la "deuda técnica" blabla

Hablar de que lo habíamos hecho en un equipo que estaba en un contexto de eXtraction.

Hablar del reto que supone empezar a hacerlo en equipos en un contexto de eXplore,
y de escasez debido a la crisis del coronavirus.

Notas:
* Edu Mateu, Marc Sturlese and Hernán Castagnola were then the B2B team lead, the CTO and the CPO, respectively.

* positive loops are self-preserving

* In systems thinking a leverage point is a place within a complex system (a corporation, an economy, a living body, a city, an ecosystem) where a shift can be applied to produce changes in the whole system behavior. It would be a low leverage point if a small shift produces a small behavioral change. It's a high leverage point if a small shoif causes a large behavioral change. 



"You can't change anything from outside it. Standing apart, looking down, taking the overview, you see the pattern. What's wrong, what's missing. You want to fix it. But you can't patch it. You have to be in it, weaving it. You have to be part of the weaving."
—U. K. Le Guin

"A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it."

New metaphors are capable of creating new understandings and, therefore, new realities"

"Not surprisingly, the social reality defined by a culture affects its conception of physical reality. What is real for an individual as a member of a culture is a product both of his social reality and of the way in which that shapes his experience of the physical world."
