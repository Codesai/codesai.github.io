<h2>Introduction. </h2>

We are going to show a possible solution [the Beverages Prices Refactoring kata](/2019/04/beverages_prices_kata) that we developed recently with some people from [Women Tech Makers Barcelona](https://www.meetup.com/wtmbcn/) with whom I'm doing [Codesai's Practice Program](https://github.com/Codesai/practice_program) twice a month.

[The Beverages Prices Refactoring kata](/2019/04/beverages_prices_kata) shows an example of inheritance gone astray. The initial code computes the price of the different beverages that are sold in a coffe house. There are some supplements that can be added to those beverages. Each supplement increases the price a bit. Not all combinations of drinks and supplements are possible.

As part of the kata, we are asked to **add an optional cinnamon supplement that costs 0.05â‚¬ to all our existing catalog of beverages**. We are also advised to refactor the initial code a bit before introducing the new feature. Let's see why.

<h2>The initial code. </h2>

To get an idea of the kind of problem we are facing, we'll have a look at the code. There are 8 files: a `Beverage` interface and classes for each type of beverages and for each allowed combination of beverage and supplements.

A closer look reveals that the initial design uses inheritance and polymorphism to enable the differences in computing the price of each allowed combination of beverage and supplements. This is the inheritance hierarchy:

If that diagram is not enough to scare you, have a quick look at the unit tests of the code:

<h2>A bit of preparatory refactoring first. </h2>

Given the current design, if we decided to add the new feature straigth away, we'd end up with 14 classes (2 * the initial number of classes). If you think about it, this would happen for each new supplement we decided to add. This design would force us to double the number of classes for each new supplement we decided to add. If we added n supplements, we'd multiply the initial number of classes by 2<sup>n</sup>.

This is a fine example of a code smell called **Combinatorial Explosion*<a href="#nota1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>). In this case, the problem is caused by using inheritance to represent the pricing of beverages plus supplements. 

In order to make it easier to introduce the new feature, we did a bit of preparatory refactoring first to remove this code smell.
