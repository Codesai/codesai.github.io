In the last quarter of 2017 we delivered [several TDD trainings at Merkle’s offices in Barcelona](/2017/12/we-were-at-merkle-comet) and did several consulting session with their JavaScript and Java teams. [Merkle](https://www.merkleinc.com/emea/) is a consulting company with high quality standards, so we were very happy when they contacted us to collaborate again this year doing several TDD trainings and consulting sessions.

One of the main novelties of this year's collaboration with Merkle is a 4 months deliberate practice program aimed to improve the object-oriented design, refactoring and TDD skills of a group of about 22 developers. We'll give more details about this deliberate practice program in a future post.

So far we have done the first round of consulting sessions and the first of the TDD trainings. It was a very special one because it was the first test drive of our revamped training material. We have improved on the version of the training material that Luis Rovirosa created with us. We have edited some parts that we thought were less valuable, and added new modules that reflects better the way we understand TDD at Codesai. We are looking forward to having the next consulting sessions and TDD trainings.

Before finishing this post, we would love to thank Merkle (and especially [Nelson Cardenas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelsoncardenas/)) for trusting us again to train and help grow their developers skills.
