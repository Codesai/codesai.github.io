# Introduction

In my current client we are having some time to learn new things outside of our current context/stack. The people on the team asked for an introduction to Docker because I introduced it for our CI and some local testing to remove connecting to real environments from the local machines to run the integration tests.

So I was the person designated to do it. And here I want to share the way to learn Docker from scratch I thought myself.

# Learn by doing

I really believe in the philosophy for learning new things is tighly related with practise, practise, practise... And that's also Codesai DNA, so I wanted to ideate an idea to share some initial context with a some theory of Docker. To answer:

- The whys:
  - Why Docker?
  - Differences with the past technologies
  - Why is better than the previous tooling?
- The hows:
  - How Docker solve the problem?
  - How Docker improve the previous problem?
  - How Docker can help us?

After that I wanted to create an small exercise where the people could assemble two different applications with different languages and let them see one of the advantages of Docker. **Removing the complexity on dedicated infrastructure** for a concrete language/stack.

And for the last trick I wanted them to see how easy is to build, push an image and publish your Docker container in a famous service as Heroku. So in the last part of the workshop we do that explained with some easy steps that can be also found on the README of the Heroku folder.

So I want you to check it yourself and bring me some feedback and enjoy what I prepared too. **Let's Dockerize everything!!**.

Here is the repository with the content and the exercises. **Each folder has a README.md** explaining what to do. The main README.md is just theory of Docker. Enjoy! [Docker Workshop Repo](https://github.com/Groxalf/docker-workshop)
