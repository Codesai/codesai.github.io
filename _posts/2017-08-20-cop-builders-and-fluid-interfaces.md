In a [previous post](/2017/07/two-examples-of-connascence-of-position) we talked about *positional parameters* and how they can suffer from **Connascence of Position, (CoP)**. Then we saw how, in some cases, we might introduce *named parameters* to remove the *CoP* and transform it into **Connascence of Name, (CoN)**, but always being careful of not hiding cases of **Connascence of Meaning, (CoM)**. Today we'll focus in languages that don't provide *named parameters* and see different techniquess to remove the CoP.

In those languages without *named parameters* there is a classic<a href="#nota1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> refactoring technique, [Introduce Parameter Object](https://refactoring.com/catalog/introduceParameterObject.html), that in many cases can also help you to **transform CoP into CoN**.

As it happened with *named parameters*, we also have to be careful of not accidentally sweeping hidden CoM in the form of [data clumps](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1400866&seqNum=8) under the rug when we use the [Introduce Parameter Object](https://refactoring.com/catalog/introduceParameterObject.html) refactoring.

In any case, what it's clear is that **introducing a parameter object produces much less expressive code than introducing named parameters**. So how to *gain semantics while removing CoP* in languages without *named parameters*?

One answer is using [fluent interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface)<a href="#nota2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> which is a technique that is much more common than you think. Let's have a look at the following small piece of code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/26422c2a60a7ec79be7422e561c435ff.js"></script>

This is just a simple test. However, just in this small piece of code, we can find two examples of removing *CoP* using [fluent interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) and another example that, while not removing *CoP*, completely removes its impact on expressiveness. Let's look at them with more detail.

The first example is an application of the [builder pattern](http://wiki.c2.com/?BuilderPattern) using a *fluent interface*<a href="#nota3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/d42762b85c695226f069430214d69110.js"></script>

Applying the *builder pattern* provides a very specific<a href="#nota4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> [internal DSL](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/InternalDslStyle.html) that we can use to create a complex object avoiding CoP and also getting an expressiveness comparable or even superior to the one we get using *named parameters*. 

In this case we composed two builders, one for the _SafetyRange_ class:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/d7eab5609348590f7eb070edad4017c1.js"></script>

and another for the _Alarm_ class:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/def882d4489f9906408b3c1626a23057.js"></script>

*Composing builders* you can manage to create very complex objects in a maintanable and very expressive way.

Let's see now the second interesting example in our small piece of code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/948bd5895f903f2b7ac9a22bfc18a5e6.js"></script>

This assertion is so simple that the [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit5/) alternative is even clearer than the previous one using [hamcrest](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hamcrest/wikis/Tutorial.wiki):

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/8127ee504363613bacd7d3a0e5925f03.js"></script>

but for more than one parameter the *JUnit* interface starts having problems: 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/55d79c4b44d4df309b8cc9d92550a3ad.js"></script>

Which one is the *expected value* and which one is the *actual one*? We never manage to remember...

Using *hamcrest* removes that expressiveness problem:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/a93a36a190009b1ee8a9946b9754d16a.js"></script>

Thanks to the semantics introduced by *hamcrest*<a href="#nota6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, it's very clear that the first parameter is the actual value and the second parameter is the expected on. The *internal DSL* defined by *hamcrest* produces declarative code with high expressiveness. To be clear **hamcrest is not removing the CoP**, but since there are only two parameters the degree of CoP is very low<a href="#nota7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. The problem of the code using the *JUnit* assertion was its low expressiveness and *hamcrest* fixed that.

For us it's curious how, in *trying to achieve expressiveness, some assertion libraries that use *fluent interfaces* have (probably not being aware of it) eliminate CoP as well. See this example using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/):

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/2c205cd115015baceace3a5483ac23c5.js"></script>

Finally, let's have a look at the last example in our initial small piece of code which is using a *fluent interface*:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/168c5a69b6faf8443789d5f7c9a5a75b.js"></script>

This is [Mockito](http://site.mockito.org/)'s way of defining a stub. It's another example of using a *fluent interface* which again produces highly expressive code and avoids CoP.

### Summary.
We started seeing how, in languages that don't allow *named parameters*, we can remove CoP by applying the *Introduce Parameter Object* refactoring and how the resulting code was much less expressive than the one using the *Introducing Named Parameters* refactoring. Then we saw how we can leverage *fluent interfaces* to remove CoP while writing high expressive code, mention internal DSLs and show you how this technique is more common that one can think at first but examining a small piece of code.
